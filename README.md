# Image Recognition via CNN

This notebook implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) for identifying dog breeds from photos. The notebook aslo uses OpenCV for recognizing human faces in photos, and leverages transfrer learning from RestNet50 to optimize accuracy despite the small training set.
