# Image Recognition with Convolutional NN

This notebook implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying dog breeds in photos. 

The notebook aslo uses OpenCV for identifying human faces in photos, and leverages transfrer learning from RestNet50 to optimize accuracy despite the small training set.

When a human face is detected in a photo, the model attempts to find a resembling dog breed. Accuracy is a subjective thing in this case, but the model thinks that Zuckerberg looks like a Silky Terrier!
